# Hey there! 👋 Welcome to My Digital Space

So... you found my personal website repository! I'm Saleh, a Saudi programmer from Al-Qassim 🌴 - who loves turning ideas into code. This little corner of the internet is where I showcase who I am and what I'm passionate about.

## What You'll Find Here 🌟

I built this website to be more than just another boring portfolio. It's got some cool stuff:

- **Multiple Ways to Stalk Me**: Just kidding! But seriously, all my contact info is there

## The Tech Stuff (For Fellow Nerds) 🛠️

Built this with:
- **HTML5** - The foundation
- **CSS3** - Made it pretty with gradients and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks needed, just pure JS magic
- **A Saudi Flag Video** -  🇸🇦
